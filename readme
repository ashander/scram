scram: sacramento county retriever and munger

wrapping the Sacramento County Open Data api

In the directory where the module is used, create
file called .env, containing a single line:

SAC_API_KEY=21235avalidapikey142

The part after = should be an actual api key obtained
from http://data.saccounty.net/developers/

The module provides three functions:

 - available() :
     stream the guids available in datastreams to process.stdout
 - info(guid, infoProcessor):
     print info about a guid (or process with a custom callback function
     infoProcessor)
 - data(guid, limit=50, streamProcessor):
     stream data from guid to process.stdout (or process with a custom
     callback function streamProcessor)
